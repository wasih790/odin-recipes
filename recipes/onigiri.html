   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. </li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
            <li>Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
            <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
