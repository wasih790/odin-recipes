    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Bottle of Carbonated Water</li>
        <li>4 - 5 Tablespoons of Honey</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>1 Lemon/Lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Zest the Lime</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crush the coriander and mix it with the lime</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Shred the coriander leaves and crush them.</li>
                <li>Now squeeze the lemon and add the juice into the crushed coriander along with the zested lime. Again continue with the crushing until the ingredients form a fine paste. </li>
                <li>Now strain the mixture that you have created and keep it separate.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Caramelize the honey</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the honey in a saucepan (well a small cup should suffice too) and heat it till it starts boiling.</li>
                <li>Now simmer the flames and cook it till the honey caramelizes (till it becomes nutty brown, you should get a slightly burnt smell by the time the honey caramelizes).</li>
                <li> Ideally, youâ€™d leave the honey one for a minute or two at the most. The slightly burnt smell is ideally your cue to stop.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>

        <li>Making the syrup</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Now mix the strained coriander-lime mixture and the caramelized honey to make the cola syrup.</li>
            </ul>

        <br>    
        <li>Summon the cola</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Final step, take a small quantity of the cola syrup that you have just prepared and mix it with carbonated water to ready your homemade cola.</li>
                <li>Ideally add around 200 ml of carbonated water to 3-4 tbsp of the cola syrup</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
